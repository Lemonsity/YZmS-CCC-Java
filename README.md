# YZmS-CCC-Java

Hi. My name is Youzhang, but you can call me Mark

I made this repository hoping that it would inspire some people.

I know a group of people who are really good at programming, and I am glad that I 
know such group of people. There is only one problem: When I ask them questions, 
they use words that I simply don't understand. Unlucky for me, they are usually
busy with their life, which means they don't have much time to explain everything 
to me. 
    
That is why I try my best to document codes in this repository, hoping that it will
make it easier for YOU to understand

If you want to know more about my code, below is my email

youzhang.mark.sun@gmail.com

## Additional Notes:
1. I develop using Intellij Community edition. All the commits and push are done straight through the IDE, it is quite convenience for a noob like me.
2. All questions can be found on dmoj.ca,
   Huge shout-out to the amazing people that built the website
