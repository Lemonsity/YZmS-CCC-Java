# YZmS-CCC-Java

Hi. My name is Youzhang, but you can call me Mark

I made this repository hoping that it would inspire some people.

    I know a group of people who are really good at programming, and I am glad that I 
    know such group of people. There is only one problem: When I ask them questions, 
    they use words that I simply don't understand. Unlucky for me, they are usually
    busy with their life, which means that don't have much time to explain everything 
    to me. 
    
    That is why I try my best to document codes in this repository, hoping that it will
    make it easier for YOU, to understand
